# Graphing Calculator

## Design Specification

The program is built with ggame for it requires graphic elements. It is programmed with Python 3. The program can be disintegrated into five parts.
1. The distribution of different functions, which can be realized by conditionals.
2. Determining the start and end of the function graph saves unnecessary operations. Different types of functions have different ways(mathematical, artificial)  



* What tools or frameworks will you use to build the project (e.g. http://runpython.com or ggame)?
* What language will you use for coding (usually Python 3)?
* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
